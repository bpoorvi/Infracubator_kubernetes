Persistent volume as hostpath

In mongodb-pod-definition.yaml, hostPath defined as /data

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: mongo-pod
 labels:
   db: mymongodb
spec:
 containers:
 - name: mongo-container
   image: mongo
   ports:
   - containerPort: 8080
   volumeMounts:
   - mountPath: /data/db
     name: mongo-volume
 volumes:
 - name: mongo-volume
   hostPath:
    path: /data
    type: DirectoryOrCreate

kubectl create -f mongodb-pod-definition.yaml

restarted the metadata-service pods after creating mongo pod.

Port forward to 8090 to add some data and verify,
kubectl port-forward metadata-service-ztg97 8090:8080

Ran curl command and added some test data to the db,

To verify the hostPath,login to node minikube

 minikube ssh
cd /data/
 and verified the collection files created by mongo DB for the added data.

To verify hostPath has the same data as container,

kubectl exec -it mongo-pod -- sh
inside shell cd /data/db

Verifed same collections files as hostPath for the added entry in DB

kubectl delete pod mongo-pod - to delete the mongo pod

Verified the database entry still exists on hostPath even after deleting the mongo pod.
